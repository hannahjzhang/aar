      <h3>In a Broader Framework</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>This section places the findings in the analysis portion of the project in a broader framework by generalizing the individual recommendations so that they can be applicable for any business. This ensures that any business, even if they were not interviewed, is able to get accurate suggestions on how to improve their websites. The general features necessary for each stage is shown below.</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Awareness</th>
          <th>Interest</th>
          <th>Desire</th>
          <th>Action</th>
          <th>Loyalty</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Basic features (e.g. contact info, mission statement, about us, homepage)</td>
          <td>Updated info (e.g. COVID-19 policies, blog, updates, new arrivals, testimonials)</td>
          <td>Engagement (e.g. social share, contact, email list, internal links, videos)</td>
          <td>Advanced features (e.g. e-commerce, discounts, save for later, members only page)</td>
          <td>Advanced features (e.g. rewards program, thank you page, giveaways)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Applicable to All</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Page aesthetic (e.g. color, font, segment info, images, differentiation, clutter, page design, white space)</td>
          <td>Flexiblity (e.g. browser compatibility, responsiveness, speed, mobile-friendliness, user opinion, SEO</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      <h3>Potential Next Steps</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>After completing this project, it might be interesting to do further research in various factors like cost and impact that might affect the implementation of each idea. If even further research is possible, numerical data about the benefits of each suggestion can be gathered, analyzed, and then ordered into a detailed list. After finding detailed information about the cost and benefits of each suggestion, a controlled study could also be done where various features are implemented and evaluated to finalize the order of implementation list. This would make the suggestions for each business even more personalized and accurate.</p>
